  Welcome!

  I am currently holding a postdoctoral position in Public Health at the University of Liverpool. My research primarily centers on examining how welfare reforms impact health outcomes. Before joining the University of Liverpool, I pursued my doctoral studies in Economics at the University of Glasgow.
